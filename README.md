## Overview

This project aims to provide insights into market basket data using machine learning techniques. It analyzes customer transactions to identify patterns and 

associations between products purchased, helping businesses make data-driven decisions for inventory management, marketing, and customer segmentation.

## Dependencies

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x: You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required Python Libraries

- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms.
- Matplotlib: For data visualization.
- Seaborn: For enhancing data visualization.
- Apriori Algorithm: For association rule mining.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the code and obtain market basket insights:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samyuktha343/market-basket-insights.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd market-basket-insights
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Install the required Python libraries as mentioned in the "Dependencies" section.

4. **Data Preparation:**

   Place your market basket transaction data in the `data` folder. The data should be in a CSV format, with columns like `transaction_id` and `product_id`.

5. **Configure Parameters:**

   Open the `config.py` file and set the required parameters, such as support and confidence thresholds for association rule mining.

6. **Run the Code:**

   Execute the main script to analyze the market basket data.

   ```bash
   python market_basket_analysis.py
   ```

   The script will perform data preprocessing, association rule mining, and generate insights.

7. **View Results:**

   The results and visualizations will be saved in the `output` folder. You can explore them to gain insights into market basket data.

## Configuration

You can customize the behavior of the code by modifying the parameters in the `config.py` file. Some of the key configurations include:

- `DATA_FILE`: Path to the input transaction data file.
- `OUTPUT_DIR`: Path to the output directory where results will be saved.
- `MIN_SUPPORT`: Minimum support threshold for Apriori algorithm.
- `MIN_CONFIDENCE`: Minimum confidence threshold for association rules.
- Other parameters related to visualization and data preprocessing.

## Results

The code will generate various insights and visualizations, including:

- Association rules with support and confidence values.
- Frequent itemsets.
- Visualizations of itemset support and association rules.

# Market Basket Insights with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to provide insights into market basket data using machine learning techniques. It analyzes customer transactions to identify patterns and 

associations between products purchased, helping businesses make data-driven decisions for inventory management, marketing, and customer segmentation.

## Dataset Source

The dataset used in this project is the "Market Basket Insights" dataset, which can be obtained from the Kaggle at the following URL: [Market Basket Insights]

(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aslanahmedov/market-basket-analysis). This dataset contains transaction records of an customer purchasing data, which primarily sells unique 

all-occasion gifts. The data is in the form of transaction records and includes information such as BillNo, Item name,Quantity,date,Price,CustomerID,Country.

**Dataset Description:**

- *Bill No*:6-digit number assigned to each transaction. Nominal.
-*Item name*:Product name. Nominal.
-*Quantity*:The quantities of each product per transaction. Numeric.
-*Date*:The day and time when each transaction was generated.
-*Numeric Price*:Product price. Numeric.
-*Customer ID*:5-digit number assigned to each customer. Nominal.
-*Country*:Name of the country where each customer resides. Nominal.

## Dependencies

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x: You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads).
